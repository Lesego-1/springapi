# 🌟 User API - Spring Boot REST API

This is a simple **Java Spring Boot REST API** that allows you to manage users with **GET**, **POST**, and **DELETE** endpoints. The project stores users in memory using a simple `List<User>` for demonstration purposes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **GET /user** 🔍
  Retrieve user information.  
  - If `id` is provided as a query parameter, returns a single user.
  - If `id` is not provided, returns all users.

- **POST /user** ✏️
  Create a new user.  
  - Accepts JSON body containing user details (id, name, age, email).

- **DELETE /user/{id}** ❌
  Delete a user by ID.  
  - Returns `204 No Content` if deleted, or `404 Not Found` if the user does not exist.
